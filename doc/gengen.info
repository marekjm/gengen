********

GNU Gengen (_GENerator GENerator_) is a tool that, starting from a
parameterized text, called _template_, generates a text generator that
can substitute parameters with values.

   This manual is written for C++ and C programmers, specifically the
_lazy_ ones ;-).  If you've written any non-trivial code generator, you
probably had to write many `cout <<' or `printf' lines of code, mixing
fixed text to be generated and parts based on the value of some
variables.   If the text to be generated is full of parts that have to
be substituted at run-time, your code will end up containing many
instructions that print constant strings and variables; this will tend
to make the text to be generated unclear and thus also more difficult to
maintain.   Gengen can save you from this work, leaving you free to
focus on the text that has to be generated.

   Indeed the code to be generated will be written in a separated file
(that we call _template_ file) that can contain variable parts (that we
call _parameters_ or _variables_); Gengen will generate the generator
for you and this generator will also accept the values that will be
substituted in the output.

   I started to develop Gengen while maintaining _GNU Gengetopt_(1),
since I had to generate a big amount of code and I found it quite hard
to write code to generate it, since the program ended up being full of
many printf!  That code was unclear and quite hard to maintain.

   At the moment Gengen generates C++ or C code; however other target
languages are under development (e.g., Java).

   NOTICE: Gengen uses code generated by Gengen itself :-)

GNU Gengen Copying Conditions
*****************************

GNU Gengen is free software; you are free to use, share and modify it
under the terms of the GNU General Public License that accompanies this
manual.

   The code that Gengen generates is also free software; however it is
licensed with a simple all-permissive license instead of the GPL or

including incorporating it into or linking it with proprietary software.


File: gengen.info,  Node: Installation,  Next: The Problem,  Prev: Copying,  Up: Top

1 Installation
**************

See the file `INSTALL' for detailed building and  installation
instructions; anyway if you're used to compiling Linux software that
comes with sources you may simply follow the usual procedure, i.e. untar
the file you downloaded in a directory and then:

     cd <source code main directory>
     ./configure
     make
     make install

   Note: unless you specify a different install directory by `--prefix'
option of configure (e.g. `./configure --prefix=<your home>'), you must
be root to run `make install'.

   Files will be installed in the following directories:

`executables'
     `/prefix/bin'

`docs'
     `/prefix/share/doc/gengen'

`examples'
     `/prefix/share/doc/gengen/examples'

`additional files'
     `/prefix/share/gengen'

   Default value for prefix is `/usr/local' but you may change it with
`--prefix' option to configure.

1.1 Download
============

You can download it from GNU's ftp site: `ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gengen'
or from one of its mirrors (see `http://www.gnu.org/prep/ftp.html').

   I do not distribute Windows binaries anymore; since, they can be
easily built by using Cygnus C/C++ compiler, available at
`http://www.cygwin.com'.  However, if you don't feel like downloading
such compiler, you can request such binaries directly to me, by e-mail
(find my e-mail at my home page) and I can send them to you.

   Archives are digitally signed by me (Lorenzo Bettini) with GNU gpg
(`http://www.gnupg.org'). My GPG public key can be found at my home
page (`http://www.lorenzobettini.it').

   You can also get the patches, if they are available for a particular
release (see below for patching from a previous version).

1.2 Anonymous Git Access
========================

This project's git repository can be checked out through the following
clone instruction(1):

     git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gengen.git

   Further instructions can be found at the address:

   `http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gengen'.

   And the git repository can also browsed on-line at

   `http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/gengen.git'.

   Please note that this way you will get the latest development sources
of Gengen, which may also be unstable.  This solution is the best if
you intend to correct/extend this program: you should send me patches
against the latest git repository sources.

   If, on the contrary, you want to get the sources of a given release,
through git, say, e.g., version X.Y.Z, you must specify the tag
`rel_X_Y_Z'.

   When you compile the sources that you get from the git repository,
before running the `configure' and `make' commands, for the first time,
you must run the command:

     sh autogen.sh

This will run the autotools commands in the correct order, and also copy
possibly missing files.  You should have installed recent versions of `automake'
and `autoconf' in order for this to succeed.

   Instead of running `autogen.sh' another option is to run

     autoreconf -i

1.3 What you need to build gengen
=================================

Gengen has been developed under GNU/Linux, using gcc (C++), and bison
(yacc) and flex (lex), and ported under Win32 with Cygnus
C/C++compiler, available at `http://www.cygwin.com'.  I used the
excellent GNU Autoconf and GNU Automake.  I also used Autotools
(`ftp://ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu/pub/elef/autotools') which creates a
starting source tree (according to GNU standards) with autoconf,
automake starting files.

   Finally I used _GNU gengetopt_
(`http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt'), for command line parsing.

   Actually, you don't need all these tools above to build gengen
because I provide generated sources, unless you want to develop gengen.

1.4 Patching from a previous version
====================================

If you downloaded a patch, say `gengen-1.3-1.3.1-patch.gz' (i.e., the
patch to go from version 1.3 to version 1.3.1), cd to the directory
with sources from the previous version (gengen-1.3) and type:

     gunzip -cd ../gengen-1.3-1.3.1.patch.gz | patch -p1

   and restart the compilation process (if you had already run
configure a simple make should do).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Since version 1.4.2 of Gengen the CVS repository was dismissed
in favor of Git (`http://git-scm.com/').

2 Generating code or text from within a program
***********************************************

Say you are writing a C/C++ program and at some point your program has
to generate the following code:

     if (i < 10)
       printf("the value of i is %d", i);

It is not so difficult to write this piece of C++ code:

     cout << "if (i < 10)" << endl;
     cout << "  printf(\"the value of i is %d\", i);" << endl;

or the C code:

     printf("if (i < 10)\n");
     printf("  printf(\"the value of i is %%d\", i);\n");

provided that you remember to escape the `"' (and in the C code, also
the `%').

   Suppose now that the previous piece of code has to be generated many
times by your program, and every time instead of `i' another symbol has
to be generated (decided at run time).  In this case, supposing that
this value is contained in a variable `symb', the code for generating
this code would be a little bit more complex:

     cout << "if (" << symb << "< 10)" << endl;
     cout << "  printf(\"the value of " << symb << " is %d\", "
          << symb << ");" << endl;

And the C version would be even more obfuscated.

   Probably you didn't even realize that you forgot to leave a space
before the `< 10'; basically this is due to the fact that this piece of
code mixes the code that has to be generated with the code that
generates it, and this tends to make this part of program less easy to
maintain.  Especially if some day you have to change the code that has
to be generated, you'll have to act on this part of the program, and
probably you'll have to execute some tests in order to be sure that you
did it right.

   If the code that you have to generate is a slightly more complex,
the task may easily become a pain in the neck!

3 How Gengen Can Help You
*************************

Wouldn't it be nice if you could write the code to be generated in a
separate file, let's call it _template_, say `test1.cc_skel' this way

     if (@i@ < 10)
       printf("the value of @i@ is %d", @i@);

and have a tool that generates a generator, that you can instantiate at
run-time with the value that has to be substituted to the _parameter_
`i'?  If such a tool existed, and it generated a file `test1_c.h' with
a C struct `test1_gen_struct', then you could write simply this code,
in another file, say `test1_gen_c.c':

     #include <stdio.h>

     #include "test1_c.h"

     int
     main()
     {
       struct test1_gen_struct gen_struct;
       gen_struct.i = "foo";
       generate_test1(stdout, &gen_struct, 0);
       printf("\n");
       gen_struct.i = "bar";
       generate_test1(stdout, &gen_struct, 0);
       printf("\n");

       return 0;
     }

   Alternatively, if it generated a file `test1.h' with a C++ class
`test1_gen_class', then you could write simply this code, in another
file, say `test1_gen.cc':

     #include <iostream>

     using std::cout;
     using std::endl;

     #include "test1.h"

     int
     main()
     {
       test1_gen_class gen_class;
       gen_class.set_i("foo");
       gen_class.generate_test1(cout);
       cout << endl;
       gen_class.set_i("bar");
       gen_class.generate_test1(cout);
       cout << endl;

       return 0;
     }

and when you run it you would obtain the expected output:

     if (foo < 10)
       printf("the value of foo is %d", foo);
     if (bar < 10)
       printf("the value of bar is %d", bar);

Well, Gengen does right this!  Now the code that has to be generated
and the code that generates it are separated and they can be maintained
more easily: if you want to change the code that has to be generated
you act on the file `test1.cc_skel'; alternatively, say you need to
change the value that will be substituted for `i', you just change the
file `test1_gen.cc' or `test1_gen_c.c'.

   Notice that the method `generate_test1' accepts an output stream
(indeed in this example the standard output stream `cout' is used),
thus the stream abstraction facilities can be exploited.  Similarly, the
C function `generate_test1' accepts a `FILE*', so you can use the C
file abstraction.

   Indeed in order to generate the C++ file `test1.h' with the class
`test1_gen_class', I simply had to run the following command:

     gengen -i test1.cc_skel --file-name test1.h --gen-name test1

and in order to generate the C file `test1_c.h' with the structure
`test1_gen_struct', I simply had to run the following command:

     gengen -i test1.cc_skel --file-name test1_c.h --gen-name test1 \
             --output-format=c

If I caught your attention and you would like to know more about these
options and more advanced features of Gengen, I hope you read on :-)

4 Basic Usage in C and C++
**************************

We've run Gengen, and used it to produce a really spiffy, if rather
pointless, program.  Now we'll go back and look at things in more
detail.

   The input file for Gengen is basically any text file, where some
parts are interpreted differently, namely symbols enclosed in `@'.   We
call this input file a _template_ and the symbols enclosed in `@'
_parameters_ (or _variables_):

     This is @name@ generated by the program @progname@.
     The code of @progname@ that generated this text was
     generated by @generator@ version @version@, made by
     Lorenzo Bettini <foobar@@foo.org>.

First all notice that, since `@' is a special character, if you really
want it to appear in the generated text you have to repeated, as in the
e-mail address `foobar@@foo.org'.

   If this text is stored in the file `example_text.text_skel' and I
process it with the following command:

     gengen -i example_text.text_skel
       --file-name example_text_c.h --gen-name example_text
       --output_format=c

the struct `example_text_gen_struct' (option `--gen-name example_text')
will be generated in the file `example_text_c.h' (option `--file-name
example_text_c.h').  This struct will have a field for each single
parameter, with the same name of the parameter and type `const char *'.
 For in instance in this example it will contain the fields `name',
`progname', `generator' and `version'.   These can be used to set the
string that will be substituted at run-time for the corresponding name
in the input file (Notice that otherwise the empty string is assumed).

   Notice that the fields of the structure are not initialized (i.e.,
they contain random values) thus we suggest to always initialize the
structure with the following generated function:

     void
     init_example_text_gen_struct(struct example_text_gen_struct *record);

   Once these values are set, the function

     void generate_example_text(FILE *stream,
             example_text_gen_struct *record, unsigned int indent)

can be called in order to generate the text with substitutions (using
the values of the passed struct) into the stream `stream'.  The
parameter `indent' is useful to specify an indentation in the generated
text.

   Alternatively, one can use the following function (even with a non
initiliazed struct) specifying the values for each field (notice the
`p' after `generate'):

     void
     generatep_example_text(FILE *stream, unsigned int indent,
             const char *generator, const char *name, const char *progname,
             const char *version);

   The following example uses the generated struct in order to generate
the text twice; the second time, the name of the parameter `name' is
changed, and the indentation is set to 2(1):

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include "example_text_c.h"

     int
     main()
     {
       struct example_text_gen_struct gen_struct;
       init_example_text_gen_struct(&gen_struct);
       gen_struct.name = "an example";
       gen_struct.progname = "example_text_gen";
       gen_struct.generator = "Gengen";
       gen_struct.version = "1.0";

       generate_example_text(stdout, &gen_struct, 0);
       printf("\n");

       printf("\n");
       gen_struct.name = "another example";
       printf("  ");
       generate_example_text(stdout, &gen_struct, 2);
       printf("\n");

       return 0;
     }

The output of this program will be as expected:

     This is an example generated by the program example_text_gen.
     The code of example_text_gen that generated this text was
     generated by Gengen version 1.0, made by
     Lorenzo Bettini <foobar@foo.org>.

       This is another example generated by the program example_text_gen.
       The code of example_text_gen that generated this text was
       generated by Gengen version 1.0, made by
       Lorenzo Bettini <foobar@foo.org>.

   Now, since C lacks the (wonderful :-) stream abstraction that permits
creating a stream that writes into a string (such as the
`ostringstream'),  two additional functions are provided in the
generated file, that return a (`malloc'ed) string instead of generating
the output to a file (they correspond to the two generate functions
seen above):

     char *
     genstring_example_text(struct example_text_gen_struct *record,
             unsigned int indent);

     char *
     genstringp_example_text(unsigned int indent,
             const char *generator, const char *name, const char *progname,
             const char *version);

Remember: it is up to you to `free' these strings when you don't need
them anymore.

   If you prefer to program in C++ you  process the file
`example_text.text_skel' with the following command(2):

     gengen -i example_text.text_skel
       --file-name example_text.h --gen-name example_text

the class `example_text_gen_class' (option `--gen-name example_text')
will be generated in the file `example_text.h' (option `--file-name
example_text.h').   This class will have a member for each single
parameter, with the same name of the parameter and type `string'.
This class will also contain a method `set_<xxx>' for each distinct
`@xxx@' present in the input file; for in instance in this example it
will contain the methods `set_name', `set_progname', `set_generator' and
`set_version'.   These methods get a `const string &' as parameter.
These can be used to set the string that will be substituted at
run-time for the corresponding name in the input file (otherwise the
empty string is assumed).

   Notice that in C++ there's no need to call any initialization
function, since the fields in the class are automatically initialized
(as empty strings) by the constructor.  Morever, there is no version
that generates a string, as in C, since you can use the class
`ostringstream'.

   Once these values are set, the method

     void generate_example_text(ostream &stream, unsigned int indent = 0)

can be called in order to generate the text with substitutions into the
stream `stream'.  The parameter `indent' (default = 0) is useful to
specify an indentation in the generated text.

   The following example uses the generated class in order to generate
the text twice; the second time, the name of the parameter `name' is
changed, and the indentation is set to 2(3):

     #include <iostream>
     #include "example_text.h"

     using std::cout;
     using std::endl;

     int
     main()
     {
       example_text_gen_class gen_class;
       gen_class.set_name("an example");
       gen_class.set_progname("example_text_gen");
       gen_class.set_generator("Gengen");
       gen_class.set_version("1.0");

       gen_class.generate_example_text(cout);
       cout << endl;

       cout << endl;
       gen_class.set_name("another example");
       cout << "  ";
       gen_class.generate_example_text(cout, 2);
       cout << endl;

       return 0;
     }

The output of this program will be as before.

   This is already a useful feature of Gengen (at least that's what I
think ;-).  However if the text to be generated requires some more
preprocessing, substituting only strings may not be enough.  Instead you
may want the generator to invoke a call back method when it comes to
generate a specific symbol.  This will be explained in the following
section.

* Callbacks::
* Types::

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Notice that the first indentation has to be performed manually;
this behavior is useful in conjunction with a more involved feature
that will be explained later.

   (2) Notice that, by default gengen produces C++ code, so you don't
need to specify the `--output-format' option.

4.1 Callbacks
=============

You may want the generator to invoke a call back method when it comes to
generate a specific symbol, instead of relying only on strings.  This
can be achieved by specifying the _type_ `method' for a parameter.  Let
me clarify this with an example.

   Say that your program has to generate some functions, and you,
obviously, want all these functions to have the same definition style;
then you can create a template file `example_fundef.cc_skel':

     @rettype@
     @funname@(@paramtype@ @param@)
     {
       @funbody:method@
     }

and once again process it with the command

     gengen -i example_fundef.cc_skel --file-name example_fundef.h
       --gen-name example_fundef

Then the generated class `example_fundef_gen_class' will  contain  the
set-methods `set_rettype',   `set_funname', `set_paramtype'     and
`set_param',   and     a    method `set_funbody',  but  it will  also
declare the following abstract method:

     virtual void
       generate_funbody(ostream &stream, unsigned int indent) = 0;

   Thus, this class cannot be directly instantiated; instead you can
derive from this class and provide the implementation of such method,
knowing that this method will be called right when it comes to generate
that part of code, in case the variable `funbody' has not already been
set via the method `set_funbody' (indeed the virtual method is called
if `funbody' is an empty string).  Here's an example that extends this
class and uses the previous class `test1_gen_class' to generate the
function body (file `example_fundef_gen.cc'):

     #include <iostream>
     #include "test1.h"
     #include "example_fundef.h"

     using std::cout;
     using std::endl;

     class my_fundef_gen : public example_fundef_gen_class
     {
      public:
       virtual void generate_funbody(ostream &stream, unsigned int indent) {
         test1_gen_class body_gen;
         body_gen.set_i (param);
         body_gen.generate_test1 (stream, indent);
       }
     };

     int
     main()
     {
       my_fundef_gen fun_gen;
       fun_gen.set_rettype ("void");
       fun_gen.set_funname ("foo_fun");
       fun_gen.set_paramtype ("unsigned int");
       fun_gen.set_param ("bar");

       fun_gen.generate_example_fundef (std::cout);
       cout << endl;

       return (0);
     }

Notice that the parameter `i' of `test1_gen_class' is set to the same
name of the inherited field `param': this will guarantee consistency in
the generated code (the code will be compilable) and the generated
function body will use the parameter of the function definition.
Moreover when the method `generate_test1' is invoked, both the `stream'
and `indent' parameters are passed over, so that they will be used also
by the other generator.

   The generated code is once again as expected:

     void
     foo_fun(unsigned int bar)
     {
       if (bar < 10)
         printf("the value of bar is %d", bar);
     }

Notice how the indentation is handled automatically!  Indeed the code
generated by Gengen is able to keep track of the indentation level
according to the leading spaces in a line.

   This scenario can take place in a code generator where you want to
have all the generated functions with the same style.  When you decide
you want to change the style you'll only have to change the file
`example_fundef.cc_skel', while the other parts of the programs remain
unchanged.

   When a generated class contains at least an abstract method, a
virtual destructor is also generated (that basically performs no
action) that is useful if you have to destroy something allocated in
the derived class.

   The type `method' has also an _option_; an option is basically a
statement of the shape `<name>=<value>' and has to be specified between
brackets `{}'.   The option is `iteration'.  If one specified
`@funbody:method{iteration=true}@' then no space would have been
generated before invoking the call back method, and no newline would
have been generated after.  This could be useful when the result of the
call back method is either the empty string or a sequence of similar
items; this way if these are handled from within a loop (the name
"iteration" comes from this) they can be handled more easily and
uniformly (otherwise you would have to treat the first element and the
last one differently).

   If you want to generate C code, you can process it with the command

     gengen -i example_fundef.c_skel --file-name example_fundef.h
       --gen-name example_fundef --output-format c

This will generate the file `example_fundef.h' containing the following
struct declaration:

     struct example_fundef_gen_struct
     {
       const char *funbody;
       const char *funname;
       const char *param;
       const char *paramtype;
       const char *rettype;
     };

and some functions

     void generate_example_fundef(FILE *stream,  struct
     example_fundef_gen_struct *record, unsigned int indent);

that, given an initialized struct, generates the output to the file
`stream', and

     void
     generatep_example_fundef(FILE *stream, unsigned int indent,
                              const char *funbody, const char *funname,
                              const char *param, const char *paramtype,
                              const char *rettype);

that does not require a struct, since it requires a value for each
parameter in the template file.

   We suggest to use the following function in order to be sure that
each string in the struct is correctly initialized to `NULL':

     void
     init_example_fundef_gen_struct(struct example_fundef_gen_struct *r);

and two additional functions are provided in the generated file, that
return a (`malloc'ed) string instead of generating the output to a file
(they correspond to the two generate functions seen above):

     char *
     genstring_example_fundef(struct example_fundef_gen_struct *record,
                              unsigned int indent);

     char *
     genstringp_example_fundef(unsigned int indent,
                               const char *funbody, const char *funname,
                               const char *param, const char *paramtype,
                               const char *rettype);

Remember: it is up to you to `free' these strings when you don't need
them anymore.

   As for the type `method', instead of creating a pure virtual method
as in C++, an extern function declaration is generated:

     extern
     void generate_funbody(FILE *stream,
                           struct example_fundef_gen_struct *record,
                           unsigned int indent);

but no code is generated for this function, so that the programmer is
required to provide a definition for this function somewhere else in
the program.   This (extern) function will be called right when it
comes to generate that part of code, in case the argument `funbody' or
the field `funbody' in the passed struct is `NULL'.

   When you use `@if@' conditionals (or `bool' parameters, see *note
Types::), the generated record fields are of type `short', and when you
use `int' parameters the fields are of type `int'.

4.2 Types
=========

So far, we dealt only with parameters of type `method' or string
parameters.  Actually, unless explicitly stated, the type of parameter
is implicitly considered as `string' (and for conditional expressions
as `bool', see *note Conditionals::).  However, the type of a parameter
can be made explicit, just like we did with `method' type.  In
particular, currently, the following basic types are available:
`string', `int' and `bool'(1).

   Since gengen does not provide variable declarations (to keep things
simple :-) you must always specify the type each time (just like for
`method' parameters), unless the type is not the default one.  Of
course, gengen will check that you use parameter types consistently,
i.e., always with the same type.

   For instance, the following code is correct, since by default the
type of a parameter is of type string, thus the parameter `mypar' is
used consistently:

     This is the value of the parameter @mypar@.
     And I repeat it here @mypar:string@.

While this example will generate an error, since the first time `mypar'
is (implicitly) of type `string', while the second time is of type
`int':

     This is the value of the parameter @mypar@.
     And I repeat it here @mypar:int@.

For instance, if this file is called `foo.skel', gengen will issue the
following error:

     foo.skel:2: variable "mypar" of type "int"
     foo.skel:2: already used with another type
     foo.skel:1: previous usage was here with type "string"

   Gengen will use the specified type to generate fields and methods of
the generated class accordintly, e.g., if a parameter is declared of
type `int' the generated set method will get an integer parameter.

   When generating a parameter of type `int' the string representation
of the actual integer value will be output; while for `bool' parameters
the literal `true' or `false' will be output.

   (1) This holds since version 1.0.

5 Conditional statements
************************

It is often useful to generate some parts only if specific conditions
are met, and other in the opposite case.  Inside the template file you
can also use the following syntax:

     @if@ condvar1 @then@
     text1
     @elseif@ condvar2 @then@
     text2
     @elseif@ ... other alternatives...
     @else@
     text_else
     @endif@

that has the same semantics of if in programming languages you're used
to, and of course all the else parts are optional.  For every `condvar'
a boolean instance variable is added to the generated class, and of
course a corresponding set method receiving a boolean argument.

   It is important to notice a possible new line characters and spaces
after a `@then@', `@else@' and `@endif@', and possible spaces before
`@if@', `@elseif@' and `@else@' are NOT discarded during the generation
of code.  Thus, the following this code

     @if@ c @then@   foo
     @else@   bar@endif@

will generate the following C++ code(1)

     if (c)
       {
         stream << "   foo";
         stream << "\n";
         stream << indent_str;
       }
     else
       {
         stream << "   bar";
       }

Notice that there are spaces before the generated strings, as there
were in the template file.

   And the following code

       @if@ c @then@
     foo
       @else@
     bar
     @endif@

will generate the following C++ code

     stream << "  ";
     if (c)
       {
         stream << "\n";
         stream << indent_str;
         stream << "foo";
         stream << "\n";
         stream << indent_str;
         indent = 2;
         stream << "  ";
       }
     else
       {
         stream << "\n";
         stream << indent_str;
         stream << "bar";
         stream << "\n";
         stream << indent_str;
       }

Notice the two characters inserted before the if test (that are
generated independently from the evaluation of `c') and the new line
before the then and else bodies.

   If you're not confortable with this treatment of spaces and new
lines in conjunction with if statements, you can use the uppercase
version of these keywords, i.e., `IF', `THEN', etc.   When you use these
keywords, spaces and newlines are skipped.   For instance, the previous
example can be rewritten as follows:

     @IF@ c @THEN@   foo
     @ELSE@   bar@ENDIF@

and the generated code will not contain the extra spaces:

     if (c)
       {
         stream << "foo";
         stream << "\n";
         stream << indent_str;
       }
     else
       {
         stream << "bar";
       }

   Notice that the space "eating" stops at the first newline, thus, the
following code:

     @IF@ c @THEN@
        foo
     @ELSE@
        bar
     @ENDIF@

will correctly consider the indentation in the then and else bodies:

     if (c)
       {
         stream << "   foo";
         stream << "\n";
         stream << indent_str;
       }
     else
       {
         stream << "   bar";
         stream << "\n";
         stream << indent_str;
       }

   Finally, you can mix uppercase and lowercase keywords in the same if
statement as you see fit.

   Of course, you can nest if inside then branches, else branches, and
so on, just like you do in your programming language:

     @if@ c1 @then@
     @if@ c2 @then@ foo2
     @elseif@ c3 @then@ foo3
     @endif@
     @else@   bar
     @if@ c4 @then@ foo4
     @endif@
     @endif@

Unfortunately, you cannot indent nested ifs.  Or better, you can
actually, but the indentation characters will be generated in the code.
If you want to indent the nested ifs you have to use the uppercase
version.

   While there is not the concept of "variable declaration" in the
template file, Gengen will check that you do use variables in a
consistent way (see *note Types::); thus you're not allowed to the same
name for a string variable and for the boolean expression of an if
statement (which is implicitly considered of type `bool').   For
instance, the following code:

     @foo@

     @if@ foo @then@ @else@ bar @endif@

will generate the following error:

     test.h_skel:3: variable "foo" of type "bool"
     test.h_skel:3: already used with another type
     test.h_skel:1: previous usage was here with type "string"

On the contrary, this version will work fine, since `foo' is used
consistently:

     @foo:bool@

     @if@ foo @then@ @else@ bar @endif@

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) In this section will use generated C++ code as an example, but
of course, the same features hold for generated C code as well.


File: gengen.info,  Node: Expression syntax,  Prev: Conditionals,  Up: Conditionals

5.1 Expression syntax
=====================

Since version 1.0, it is possible to specify complex conditional
expressions.  You then can use comparison operators `<', `>', `<=',
`>=', `='(1) and `!=', and boolean operators `and', `or' and `not'.

   The precendence of these operators is the standard one, and, of
course, you're allowed to override the precedence by using parenthesis.

   Gengen will perform type checking on the expressions (see *note
Types::), thus it will check that `and', `or' and `not' are used only
on boolean expressions, and that when using the other operators, the
operands are of the same type.  Moreover, `<', `>', `<=', `>=' cannot
be used on boolean expressions.  While they can be used on string
expressions, and in that case the standard lexicographical order will
be used for the comparison.

   In expressions you can use constants of the basic types, and in this
case you must not specify the type: it will be automatically inferred.

   Any numerical literal will be considered an integer constant; the
literals `true' and `false' will be considered boolean constants;
finally, string constants must be enclosed in `"'.

   For instance, the following is a valid expression (notice that,
since we are in the context of an if expression, parameters are
automatically considered of type `bool', thus string parameters must be
explicitly specified with type `string'):

     @if@ (not foo) and (mystring:string < "foo" or i:int > j:int) @then@
     ...

Instead, the following one

     @if@ (not foo) and (mystring < "foo") @then@
     ...

will produce the following error:

     test.h_skel:1: mystring and "foo" must have the same type
     test.h_skel:1: mystring has type bool, "foo" has type string

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This is the equality operator, not the assignment operator.

       -V, --version             Print version and exit
       -i, --input=file          input file (default std input)

           --output-dir=STRING   output directory (default current dir)
           --separate-files      output to separate files (header, source). require
                                   --file-name
           --expand-tabs         strings containing newlines are indented according
                                   to the current indentation level
           --no-gen-version      do not put gengen version in the generated file
           --test-mode           even with errors exit with 0 (this is only for
                                   testing purposes)
           --force               force regeneration of output code

Let us examine the ones not yet explained.

   `--separate-files' that makes Gengen generate the header with class
definition and a `.cc' file with the same name specified with
`--file-name', which contains the implementation of the generate
methods.

   `--expand-tabs' is pretty useful: all the variables specified in the
template files, when generated, will be correctly indented according to
the current indentation level (i.e., the indentation level at the point
where they are in the template file).  Thus, consider a slight
variation of the example seen before:

     @rettype@
     @funname@(@paramtype@ @param@)
     {
       @funbody@
     }

where `funbody' is not of type `method'.  Then, if you do not use the
`--expand-tabs' and you set the string if (bar < 10)\n  return;, then
the resulting generated code will look the following one (the other
variables are set to values as seen before):

     void
     foo_fun(unsigned int bar)
     {
       if (bar < 10)
     return;
     }

While, if you use `--expand-tabs', the string containing newlines will
be correctly formatted:

     void
     foo_fun(unsigned int bar)
     {
       if (bar < 10)
         return;
     }

   Gengen, in order to make separate compilation easier and minimize
recompilations of many files, before actually generating the output
file, checks whether a previous generated file exists and, if so,
whether there are any changes since the last generation.  If no
modification is needed, the previous generated file is not overwritten.
This saves compilations, for instance, when you use `--separate-files'
and you only change something in the template file that affects only
the code that has to be generated (i.e., the `generate' method itself),
but not the class interface.  However, if you want to force the
generation of the output file, you can do so with the option `--force'.

   The `--output-format' permits generating code different from C++ (in
the current version the other available target language is C).

   The remaining options should be self-explanatory :-)
